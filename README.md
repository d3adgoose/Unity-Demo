In my latest update to our space shooter game, I added two cool power-ups: the Weapon Upgrade and the Shield Boost. This was my first time working with Unity, which was a bit different from using Godot. I had to get used to how Unity does things, especially how it handles parts of the game and the physics.

The Weapon Upgrade makes the playerâ€™s bullets go faster and hit harder. This change makes fights quicker and more exciting because players can take down enemies faster. It's really fun during parts of the game where there are a lot of enemies.

The Shield Boost gives players a temporary shield that takes damage for them. This is super helpful for getting through tough parts of the game without getting knocked out. It makes players think more about when to attack and when to hang back and defend. Working on this in Unity was pretty cool because I got to try out new stuff and see what I could do with a different game-making tool.
